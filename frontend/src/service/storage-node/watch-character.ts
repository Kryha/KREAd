Use chain-storage-watcher to get updates on relevant characters,
including inventory information. Should write to the User context
and potentially be triggered by that same context in a useEffect.
Alternatively it could be triggered by the first interface that
consumes the User context

Commneted code is dapp-inter's implementation
